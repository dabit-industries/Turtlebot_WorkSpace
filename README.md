# Turtlebot_WorkSpace
Miscellaneous ROS scripts for the Turtlebot 2 and 2e that don't really fit into any standalone packages or repos.
This is the place that tests, snippets, and other fun stuff get put for publishing and blogging.

Wanderer (WIP):
 - Wanders around the room aimlessly with only basic guidance from a depth sensor

beep_ultrasonic:
 - Will emit a beep from the Kobuki base if the analog value from an ultrasonic hooked onto the Kobuki analog pin 4 is less than a value of 150
